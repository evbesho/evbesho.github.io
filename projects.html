                <h3>Personal Website</h3>
                <video src="PrettyGirl.MOV" controls loop width="400">Journey</video>
                <p>This website was actually my first attempt at any web development. 
                    I started my first coding class in January 2021 as a part of the general 
                    first-year engineering curriculum at Western University. I was lost as to which 
                    discipline of engineering I wanted to go into, but coding flipped a switch in
                    my brain. My programming fundamentals class began with java, but I was fascinated
                    and quickly began learning things in my free time. After watching countless videos
                    on the industry and which language to learn. I decided to focus myself on 
                    project-based learning by building a website from scratch using HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript.
