                <p>Tony attended high school at Western Canada High School in Calgary, 
                    Alberta where he was an honour roll student. Currently, I am studying 
                    engineering at the University of Western Ontario with the intent of 
                    majoring in software engineering. I am taking many classes that teach 
                    many technical and soft skills valuable to the workplace such as:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Programming Fundamentals</dt>
                        <dd>An coding class to introduce students to object-oriented programming, namely Java.</dd>
                        <li>Business for Engineers</dt>
                        <dd>A business class that teaches students the ins and outs of the workplace and about productivity.</dd>
